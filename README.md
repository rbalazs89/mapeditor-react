# Map Editor for My Hobby Game
This is a map editor built using React for my personal hobby game project. It allows users to create, edit, and manage maps in a user-friendly interface, providing tools for placing tiles, setting collisions, and organizing map elements. The goal of this editor is to simplify the map creation process and enable smooth integration with the game.
